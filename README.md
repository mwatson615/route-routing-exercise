# route-routing-exercise

Requirements

For this exercise, you're going to create a basic application, with a two views. Each view will provide information about a famous American highway. Each will have a title show the name of the highway, and an element in which the description of the highway will be displayed.

You will need:

1.  An Angular application module. Inject ngRoute into your applcation.
2.  A config section for your application where you set up two routes.
  a. Famous highway #1
  b. Famous highway #2
3.  Two controllers defined in your application.
4.  Two partials - one bound to one of the controllers.
5.  Each controller will have two scope variables.
  a. $scope.highwayName
  b. $scope.highwayDescription
6.  You provide the name and description for each highway that you find via research.

Start http-server and access both of the routes and verify that each highway's information displays correctly.

Example routes:

http://localhost:8080/#/blueridgeparkway

http://localhost:8080/#/route66
